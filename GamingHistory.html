				<div class="columnleft"><h4>Back in the 1950s and 1960s, computer games were very scarce, and not a valuable use of resources since computers had very little memory and hard to get ahold of. However, in 1961 a computer scientist 
				known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell_(computer_scientist)">Steve Russell</a> programmed what is probably the first widespread computer game of the 1960s known as <i>SpaceWar!</i>. This is what
				starts the era of video games!.
				In 1972, video games started to become more commercialized. Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney decided to utilize their partnership with Atari to revolutionize the gaming
				industry by creating Pong. The first actual arcade machine to be popularized by the rest of the community. It's wood-textured cabinet design was placed in bars and arcades alike.
				After the creation of Pong the video game market skyrocketed. Consoles were being released left and right so that families can play Pong at their homes. The golden age of videogames
				emerged in 1978 all the way until 1982, where two generations of gaming had ran its course. However, by 1983, the market had crashed due to the over-saturation of generally bad games.
				It wasn't until 1985 where the company Nintendo revived video games with the Nintendo Entertainment System. After that, the video game market has thrived ever since and continues
				to thrive today! If it were not for Nintendo, we would not have video games today.</h4>
