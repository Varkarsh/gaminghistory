            Welcome to the world of Video Gaming! This website is here to enrich you nerds 
			with the power (Now you're playing with SUPER POWER!) of the two best things ever: 
			Video Games and History! Now this will be considered a "Crash Course" in terms of: 
			basic knowledge on what happened in said era and what game(s) made an impact.
			This page is simply a welcome to the website and you can navigate around the rich
			content here! now if you have any questions simply <a href="Contact.html">contact</a> me!

         <p>
            I will begin the journey into the world from the 1950s when a couple of students from Cambridge
			invented the first video game on their computer. Travelling onwards to the 1970s where Arcades
			ushered in a new era of digital entertainment. Afterwards, will follow the beginning and temporary
			end to the console era witrh the video game crash of 1976 and 1982. Which was revived thanks to Nintendo
			in 1985, and has been popular until the present, and the future to come! I will also be discussing certain
			games that brought forth a new era (e.g the current era of Battle Royale games like Fortnite)<br>
			Every game has contributed in its own way be it positive or negative throughout the community. Eventually
			the once hobby became an actual subject of prizes with E-Sports and video game competitions.<br>

         </p>
